### COMMUNITY POST (Reddit/Facebook Group)

**Title:** I Built an AI Assistant for My TikTok Shop Students

```
Hey everyone,

I wanted to share something I just launched for my coaching program that you might find interesting.

I built an AI chatbot trained on all my TikTok Shop content (YouTube videos, TikTok posts, course materials) so my students can get instant answers to their questions.

Here's what it does:

✅ Answers questions about TikTok Shop affiliate marketing
✅ Provides detailed responses with sources
✅ Available 24/7
✅ No waittime
✅ Cites specific videos/posts where I covered the topic

I'm making it available to my coaching members, but thought I'd share the concept here in case anyone wants to build something similar.

The tech stack:
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- OpenAI API
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Vercel for hosting (free tier)
- Cost: ~$20-30/month

If anyone's interested in building something similar for their community, happy to share more details.

For my students: Link and password in your member dashboard.
