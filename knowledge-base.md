TikTok. It's only $10. That's the whole

TikTok. It's only $10. That's the whole
video. Okay, so watching this, you

video. Okay, so watching this, you
should now understand like different

should now understand like different
types of video styles. And as I'm

types of video styles. And as I'm
talking, you might say, "Oh, I could do

talking, you might say, "Oh, I could do
skits or oh, I could do this or oh, I

skits or oh, I could do this or oh, I
could do that." And obviously different

could do that." And obviously different
products work better with that. You

products work better with that. You
could not promote, you know, like a a

could not promote, you know, like a a
credit card through a skit. That kind of

credit card through a skit. That kind of
seem or actually you could. But my point

seem or actually you could. But my point
with this is like there's different

with this is like there's different
types of video styles that work better

types of video styles that work better
with other products. Bottom of funnel,

with other products. Bottom of funnel,
you have to do viral products. You could

you have to do viral products. You could
also do a skit or a talking head video

also do a skit or a talking head video
on a brand new product, but you cannot

on a brand new product, but you cannot
do that with bottom of funnel. So, as

do that with bottom of funnel. So, as
you're watching this video, I want you

you're watching this video, I want you
to really break down like, hey, could I

to really break down like, hey, could I
do skits? Could I do bottom funnel? What

do skits? Could I do bottom funnel? What
do I physically see myself like doing

do I physically see myself like doing
well in? Because if you, you know, try

well in? Because if you, you know, try
to force yourself to do skits and you're

to force yourself to do skits and you're
not an outgoing person, you're going to

not an outgoing person, you're going to
make shitty videos respectfully and no

make shitty videos respectfully and no
one's going to watch them. So, that is

one's going to watch them. So, that is
kind of the baseline of like how to make

kind of the baseline of like how to make
viral videos. All right, going in order

viral videos. All right, going in order
here. You should have an account that

here. You should have an account that
you can post on now. You should have an

you can post on now. You should have an
understanding how to find viral products

understanding how to find viral products
and you should have a very good

and you should have a very good
understanding of one what a viral video

understanding of one what a viral video
kind of looks like the structure

kind of looks like the structure
different types of content and overall

different types of content and overall
you should have a conscious idea of like

you should have a conscious idea of like
what you could see yourself doing on Tik

what you could see yourself doing on Tik
Tok shop. Now this is the juiciest part

Tok shop. Now this is the juiciest part
of the video. This all kind of aligns

of the video. This all kind of aligns
with different people's moral compasses

with different people's moral compasses
but you know how to make the videos

but you know how to make the videos
right? You can still leverage that but

right? You can still leverage that but
you also do not need to reinvent the

you also do not need to reinvent the
wheel on Tik Tok shop. Okay, I have my

wheel on Tik Tok shop. Okay, I have my
computer screen pulled up here. And if

computer screen pulled up here. And if
we kind of jump over here, you can

we kind of jump over here, you can
actually go and see other creators that

actually go and see other creators that
are doing insane numbers on Tik Tok shop

are doing insane numbers on Tik Tok shop
and just copy them. Okay, there's still

and just copy them. Okay, there's still
a little bit of skill involved here. You

a little bit of skill involved here. You
still need to understand how to make

still need to understand how to make
these viral concepts cuz you can't just

these viral concepts cuz you can't just
copy a video and do a bad job and it's

copy a video and do a bad job and it's
going to perform the same. That doesn't

going to perform the same. That doesn't
make sense, but you get the point. I'm

make sense, but you get the point. I'm
going to break down some pages here.

going to break down some pages here.
Now, I'm inside of the Tik Tok shop

Now, I'm inside of the Tik Tok shop

showing you guys this way because it's
easy for me to display this. But let's

easy for me to display this. But let's
take this girl for example, right? In

take this girl for example, right? In

of her $400,000 in sales is through

of her $400,000 in sales is through
videos. She's literally just making

videos. She's literally just making
videos. Now, her average commission rate

videos. Now, her average commission rate
is 15%. So, she's making what is 15% of

is 15%. So, she's making what is 15% of
400,000. She's making like around 50k

400,000. She's making like around 50k
60k a month in profit, which is absurd.

60k a month in profit, which is absurd.
Now, if we go look at her page, hey,

Now, if we go look at her page, hey,
this girl is doing very, very well. So,

this girl is doing very, very well. So,
do we need to, you know, like reinvent

need to understand what product you're

need to understand what product you're
going to promote. Now, for me, I always

I was in Costa Rica, literally just

I was in Costa Rica, literally just
working doing Tik Tok shop for an entire

working doing Tik Tok shop for an entire
month outside of the country, and I got

month outside of the country, and I got
very, very tanned. So, with that, I

very, very tanned. So, with that, I
actually was scrolling and found this

actually was scrolling and found this
tanning gel product. It's viral. It's

tanning gel product. It's viral. It's
picking up a lot of traction right now.

picking up a lot of traction right now.
It's on sale. It's a new product and it

It's on sale. It's a new product and it
fits me because I am tan. I can show the

fits me because I am tan. I can show the
before and after photos of me when I was

before and after photos of me when I was
pale to me versus now that I'm tan. So,

pale to me versus now that I'm tan. So,
I have a unique selling point. Now that

I have a unique selling point. Now that
I found my unique selling point, I just

I found my unique selling point, I just
simply looked at what other creators

simply looked at what other creators
were doing with that product

were doing with that product
specifically. I saw a lot of creators

specifically. I saw a lot of creators
showing a before and an after of them

showing a before and an after of them
being pale and then being tan. So, now I

being pale and then being tan. So, now I
know I'm going to make some sort of

know I'm going to make some sort of
before and after style video on this

before and after style video on this
product. And this is where now that I

product. And this is where now that I
know what I'm doing, I can let my

know what I'm doing, I can let my
creative freedom take over. Now,

creative freedom take over. Now,
obviously, all of this research I'm

obviously, all of this research I'm
doing is on this tanning gel

doing is on this tanning gel
specifically, but what's worked across

specifically, but what's worked across
different products can also work on

different products can also work on
this. It's not on a just product to

this. It's not on a just product to
product basis. So, a prime example here

product basis. So, a prime example here
is last month there was two really big

is last month there was two really big
products that I noticed and that caught

products that I noticed and that caught
my eye. One of them is a hair roller

my eye. One of them is a hair roller
where you literally roll it on your

where you literally roll it on your
hairline where you might be receding or

hairline where you might be receding or
balding and this oil comes out and helps

balding and this oil comes out and helps
you grow your hair back. And so everyone

you grow your hair back. And so everyone
in the video starts off their videos

in the video starts off their videos
just rolling their hairline and making a

just rolling their hairline and making a
joke about saving money on a trip to

joke about saving money on a trip to
Turkey and that is their hook. The other

Turkey and that is their hook. The other
one was a teeth whitening product where

one was a teeth whitening product where
they would smile and paint this pin on

they would smile and paint this pin on
their teeth while they're talking and

their teeth while they're talking and
they're visually showing what the

they're visually showing what the
product does while they're talking. So

product does while they're talking. So
I've noticed that a lot of viral videos

I've noticed that a lot of viral videos
recently are showing the products being

recently are showing the products being
used while they're saying their hook out

used while they're saying their hook out
loud. And since this tanning gel can

exactly what I did and what I used to

exactly what I did and what I used to
get your attention in the first couple

sale price which can be anywhere from 5
to 10% all the way up to 70%. So, it

to 10% all the way up to 70%. So, it
pays a lot more than WAP clipping. But,

pays a lot more than WAP clipping. But,
let's break down the pros and cons of

let's break down the pros and cons of
both and which one that I would prefer.

both and which one that I would prefer.
First things first, let's look at

First things first, let's look at
In my opinion, it is a lot more

In my opinion, it is a lot more
technical. Basically, what you're doing

technical. Basically, what you're doing
is taking a highvalue creator. Let's say

is taking a highvalue creator. Let's say
TJR Trades for example. You have to go

TJR Trades for example. You have to go
to his YouTube, his Twitch, his

to his YouTube, his Twitch, his
Instagram, his Tik Tok, all these social

Instagram, his Tik Tok, all these social
media platforms. Sort through hours of

media platforms. Sort through hours of
content to find out what you actually

content to find out what you actually
want to clip. And then once you find

want to clip. And then once you find
that, you have to put that into editing

that, you have to put that into editing
software, actually clip it, make it very

software, actually clip it, make it very
entertaining, add edits. It's very

entertaining, add edits. It's very
meticulous and you need to know how to

meticulous and you need to know how to
edit to an extent. And then when you

edit to an extent. And then when you
post it, you either get paid about a

post it, you either get paid about a
dollar per every thousand views or you

dollar per every thousand views or you
don't get paid at all depending on if

don't get paid at all depending on if
the video performs and you're competing

the video performs and you're competing
with thousands of other creators doing

with thousands of other creators doing
the exact same thing on the exact same

the exact same thing on the exact same
creator. Now, let's look at Tik Tok

creator. Now, let's look at Tik Tok
shop. Obviously, it is a similar concept

shop. Obviously, it is a similar concept
where you're making short form content

where you're making short form content
to promote products you don't own. Kind

to promote products you don't own. Kind
of like you're promoting a creator that

of like you're promoting a creator that
you're not associated with and you get

you're not associated with and you get
paid based off the sales that you

paid based off the sales that you
generate. But the difference here is

generate. But the difference here is
there are millions of different types of

there are millions of different types of
products on Tik Tok shop. Whereas, if I

products on Tik Tok shop. Whereas, if I
was clipping TGR or a different creator,

was clipping TGR or a different creator,
I'm competing with thousands of clippers

I'm competing with thousands of clippers
on just TJR. Whereas with Tik Tok shop,

on just TJR. Whereas with Tik Tok shop,
there are millions of products to where

there are millions of products to where
I can take a million different products,

I can take a million different products,
a million different selling angles, a

a million different selling angles, a
million different video types, and use

million different video types, and use
my creative freedom to make these short

my creative freedom to make these short
form content, which clearly I and you

form content, which clearly I and you
are good at, and promote that product to

are good at, and promote that product to
hopefully generate a sale. And with

hopefully generate a sale. And with
these products, there are some that are

these products, there are some that are
at zero or less than a thousand sales

at zero or less than a thousand sales
where there's not much competition

where there's not much competition
because the product is not viral yet.

because the product is not viral yet.
So, you can focus on those, but they're

So, you can focus on those, but they're
harder to promote. Or you can take the

harder to promote. Or you can take the
products that are already super viral

products that are already super viral
and just copy viral concepts and put

and just copy viral concepts and put
your own spin on it, which is very low

your own spin on it, which is very low
effort. There's even software tools, one

effort. There's even software tools, one
that I'm creating, where you can find

that I'm creating, where you can find
these viral videos and literally just

these viral videos and literally just
copy them. Now, let's talk about how

copy them. Now, let's talk about how
scalable this really is. If you clicked

scalable this really is. If you clicked
on this video, given the title of me

on this video, given the title of me
talking about not doing clipping,

talking about not doing clipping,
you're probably either clipping on

you're probably either clipping on
or you considering to clip on And

or you considering to clip on And
now that I presented an alternative,

now that I presented an alternative,
let's break down how scalable this

let's break down how scalable this
really is. With clipping, you're

really is. With clipping, you're
clipping a creator. So, you either have

clipping a creator. So, you either have
to do it yourself or hire a team of

to do it yourself or hire a team of
editors to do it for you. So, yes, it's

editors to do it for you. So, yes, it's
scalable, but there's a lot of software

scalable, but there's a lot of software
costs and employee costs as you scale.

costs and employee costs as you scale.
With Tik Tok Shop, depending on the type

With Tik Tok Shop, depending on the type
of content you're doing, we have

of content you're doing, we have
creators in our mentorship program that

creators in our mentorship program that
are making 10, 20, even $100,000 in a

single month, and they're running

single month, and they're running
multiple pages at the same time. One of

multiple pages at the same time. One of
them being bottom of funnel, where

them being bottom of funnel, where
they're literally just grabbing

they're literally just grabbing
products, making videos saying, "Hey, go

they're making high quality top offunnel

they're making high quality top offunnel

some past viral content to give you an

some past viral content to give you an
idea of what this really looks like. And

idea of what this really looks like. And
then we'll break down the payments from

these videos actually looks like, I hope

these videos actually looks like, I hope
you're getting excited and really

you're getting excited and really
understand how easy this is because you

understand how easy this is because you
just saw a video from Jack. He came into

gets a commission. It's a really cool

gets a commission. It's a really cool
flow. But with that, these videos are

flow. But with that, these videos are
extremely low effort, so he can make a

extremely low effort, so he can make a
ton of quantities of these videos. when

he came to us, he was making three to

he came to us, he was making three to
four videos a day and he wanted to make

four videos a day and he wanted to make

views are dropping, then the quality of
your videos is probably dropping as

your videos is probably dropping as

come in contact and had a conversation
with every single top affiliate that is

with every single top affiliate that is
on the platform making the most money.

on the platform making the most money.
And I've actually noticed pretty much

And I've actually noticed pretty much
all of them have at least one similarity

all of them have at least one similarity
in common. So, in this video, I'm going

in common. So, in this video, I'm going
to be breaking down every single thing

to be breaking down every single thing
that I use and that I've noticed between

that I use and that I've noticed between
all these top affiliates who are making

all these top affiliates who are making
10, 20, 50, even $100,000 in a single

literally about 2 years ago. It's still

literally about 2 years ago. It's still
so new and we are all still so early to

this, but I started pretty much on day
one when Tik Tok Shop came out when

pretty much nobody was doing it. And so

pretty much nobody was doing it. And so
I did see success very early on because

I did see success very early on because
there was low competition. And I wish I

there was low competition. And I wish I
could go back to those days. But on my

affiliates or even myself, one thing
that I've noticed with every single one

that I've noticed with every single one
of them is they all have something

unique about them. This is a common

The guy's jacked, so he is a really good

The guy's jacked, so he is a really good
fit for that type of content. There was

fit for that type of content. There was
this girl I know, she used to be a

why you're trying to do this and make

why you're trying to do this and make
this work. So, leverage that and use it.

this work. So, leverage that and use it.
Now, another common trait that I found

Now, another common trait that I found
with every single one of these Tik Tok

with every single one of these Tik Tok
shop affiliates that I spoke with, this

shop affiliates that I spoke with, this
was none of their first business models.

was none of their first business models.
Like, none of them had started Tik Tok

Like, none of them had started Tik Tok
as their very first one. They were

as their very first one. They were
coming from drop shipping, Amazon, ecom,

coming from drop shipping, Amazon, ecom,
wholesaling, real estate, like literally

wholesaling, real estate, like literally
anything. They all came from something,

anything. They all came from something,
which I thought was very unique. And

which I thought was very unique. And
what I got from that is basically most

what I got from that is basically most
people when they make their first

people when they make their first
$10,000 in a month, they think they're

$10,000 in a month, they think they're
the Excuse my French, but they

the Excuse my French, but they
think they're the They're on top

think they're the They're on top
of the world. They are bulletproof,

of the world. They are bulletproof,
right? And that can get very jaded very

right? And that can get very jaded very
fast. Now, the reason I bring this up is

fast. Now, the reason I bring this up is
because Tik Tok shop is very volatile.

because Tik Tok shop is very volatile.
If you make 10 grand in a month, I had

If you make 10 grand in a month, I had
one of my students do this last week.

one of my students do this last week.
They made 10 grand in a month for the

They made 10 grand in a month for the
first time. They were on top of the

first time. They were on top of the
world and then their sales plummeted a

world and then their sales plummeted a
week later because that one viral video

week later because that one viral video
that was going to change their life fell

that was going to change their life fell
off and now they think they're broke.

off and now they think they're broke.
They're all materialistic. They're just

They're all materialistic. They're just
like honed down on just the numbers. And

like honed down on just the numbers. And
that's the biggest thing is when you

that's the biggest thing is when you
start making money, you need to

start making money, you need to
literally be emotionless. Shut off your

literally be emotionless. Shut off your
brain. No emotions, nothing. If you make

brain. No emotions, nothing. If you make
10 grand, great. put it to the side,

10 grand, great. put it to the side,
invest it, whatever. But something has

invest it, whatever. But something has
to change where the numbers are

to change where the numbers are
literally just numbers on screen,

literally just numbers on screen,
nothing more and nothing less. If you

nothing more and nothing less. If you
get tied to 10 grand a month and a

get tied to 10 grand a month and a
million views, if your videos aren't

million views, if your videos aren't
getting a million views each time, which

getting a million views each time, which
is literally impossible to get a million

is literally impossible to get a million
views on every single video, that's just

views on every single video, that's just
not going to happen. You will get tied

not going to happen. You will get tied
into this limiting mindset and you will

into this limiting mindset and you will
eventually get burnt out. You'll have

eventually get burnt out. You'll have
three videos that pop off and then your

three videos that pop off and then your
next 30 videos that you post will get a

next 30 videos that you post will get a
couple thousand views, which is normal.

couple thousand views, which is normal.
people go through waves and you're going

people go through waves and you're going
to think it's dead or it's saturated or

to think it's dead or it's saturated or
you're burnt or it's not going to work

you're burnt or it's not going to work
and then you fall off and that is how

and then you fall off and that is how
pretty much every single person I've

pretty much every single person I've
talked to had made money and then fell

talked to had made money and then fell
off. They all fall into this trap. So,

off. They all fall into this trap. So,
uh just you literally have to be so

uh just you literally have to be so
emotionless. Another thing I noticed is

emotionless. Another thing I noticed is
they all utilize what I kind of call the

they all utilize what I kind of call the
10day method. Now, this is where you're

10day method. Now, this is where you're
basically testing for products and

basically testing for products and
seeing if this is even kind of worth

seeing if this is even kind of worth
your time to promote. So, they don't

your time to promote. So, they don't
just jump ship from product 1 2 3 4 20.

just jump ship from product 1 2 3 4 20.
They pick one or two products, even

They pick one or two products, even
three sometimes, and they hone down on

three sometimes, and they hone down on
those for a good one, two weeks and see

those for a good one, two weeks and see
what happens. Now, we've kind of tweaked

what happens. Now, we've kind of tweaked
this a bit inside of my program. We call

this a bit inside of my program. We call
the 10day method where you take three

the 10day method where you take three
products and you post one video on each

products and you post one video on each
product. So, one video on product A, one

product. So, one video on product A, one
video on product B, one video on product

video on product B, one video on product
C, and that is day one. You do the same

C, and that is day one. You do the same
thing for day 2, three, four, five,

thing for day 2, three, four, five,
etc., and you look at the similar

etc., and you look at the similar
traits. Now, by day four, if product A

traits. Now, by day four, if product A
is the one that's historically getting

is the one that's historically getting
the more views in product B and C on

the more views in product B and C on
your videos, maybe on day five or six,

your videos, maybe on day five or six,
you post three videos on just product A,

you post three videos on just product A,
or vice versa with B or C. It does not

or vice versa with B or C. It does not
matter. We're basically just picking

matter. We're basically just picking
three products that fit us. So, let's

three products that fit us. So, let's
say a tanning gel cuz I'm tan, maybe a

say a tanning gel cuz I'm tan, maybe a
hair cream because I have curly hair,

hair cream because I have curly hair,
and maybe something for my watch cuz I

and maybe something for my watch cuz I
like watches, whatever. We pick three

like watches, whatever. We pick three
products that we think fit us, they have

products that we think fit us, they have
good sales volume, whatever. Right now,

good sales volume, whatever. Right now,
we post uh three videos a day on each of

we post uh three videos a day on each of
those individual products. See what

those individual products. See what
trends we're noticing, whether it's

trends we're noticing, whether it's
retention rate, view count, likes,

retention rate, view count, likes,
comments, anything. Or even sales. Sales

comments, anything. Or even sales. Sales
would be the biggest one. What is

would be the biggest one. What is
working on our page and then honing down

working on our page and then honing down
on that? You do that for about 10 days.

on that? You do that for about 10 days.
And if you're not getting literally any

And if you're not getting literally any
conversions, if it's just dry across the

conversions, if it's just dry across the
board, find new products or change your

board, find new products or change your
content style. Um, that's another thing,

content style. Um, that's another thing,
too. If you have really low views, it's

too. If you have really low views, it's
probably your content, not the product.

probably your content, not the product.
If you have high views, no sales, it's

If you have high views, no sales, it's
the product. Okay? But moral of the

the product. Okay? But moral of the
story, all these affiliates that I've

story, all these affiliates that I've
talked to, they all understand how to

talked to, they all understand how to
test products and like actually commit

test products and like actually commit
to it and not just, you know, make

to it and not just, you know, make
literally one video on this tanning gel

literally one video on this tanning gel
and then die. Okay, prime example. I

and then die. Okay, prime example. I
literally made five videos on this. My

literally made five videos on this. My
fifth one blew up. One through four did

fifth one blew up. One through four did
not blow up, but the fifth video blew up

not blow up, but the fifth video blew up
because I looked at what happened on

because I looked at what happened on
video one, two, three, and four. And

video one, two, three, and four. And
then my fifth one got a quarter million

then my fifth one got a quarter million
views and I made some money on it. And

views and I made some money on it. And
that's all you have to do. Now, the last

that's all you have to do. Now, the last
and final thing that I've noticed is

and final thing that I've noticed is
they're all very good at either telling

they're all very good at either telling
a story or just selling. Now, this might

a story or just selling. Now, this might
have been from past experience or

have been from past experience or
whatever it may be from, but all of them

whatever it may be from, but all of them
really understand how to tell a good

really understand how to tell a good
story and how to actually sell on a

story and how to actually sell on a
psychological level. And I will break

psychological level. And I will break
that down. So, basically, when you're

that down. So, basically, when you're
telling a story, it doesn't want to just

telling a story, it doesn't want to just
be so this happened and then this

be so this happened and then this
happened and then I went to here and

happened and then I went to here and
then we did this. It's a lot of and and

then we did this. It's a lot of and and
and people don't care because it's the

and people don't care because it's the
same outcome every time compared to if

same outcome every time compared to if
you said um hey, so we did uh we went to

you said um hey, so we did uh we went to
XYZ and you wouldn't believe what

XYZ and you wouldn't believe what
happened when we were there basically.

happened when we were there basically.
So, just that one switch, you wouldn't

So, just that one switch, you wouldn't
believe what happened when we were

believe what happened when we were
there. You're basically forecasting the

there. You're basically forecasting the
next chunk of your story before even

next chunk of your story before even
telling it. I actually had one of my

telling it. I actually had one of my
creators do this. His hook, he said, um,

creators do this. His hook, he said, um,
so my mom called me the other day in

so my mom called me the other day in
tears and she was crying because all of

tears and she was crying because all of
her memories came flooding back at the

her memories came flooding back at the
ripe age of 40. That's the hook. And

ripe age of 40. That's the hook. And
then right after that, he said, "But a

then right after that, he said, "But a
little bit of backstory first." So my

little bit of backstory first." So my
mom got into a really bad car crash. And

mom got into a really bad car crash. And
just those four, like four or five

just those four, like four or five
words, but a little bit of backstory

words, but a little bit of backstory
first. Now he kind of reeled you in. He

first. Now he kind of reeled you in. He
gets to explain a good chunk of the

gets to explain a good chunk of the
story before he loses you again. And

story before he loses you again. And
then in the middle of that, he'll kind

then in the middle of that, he'll kind
of reel you back in. It's a lot of just

of reel you back in. It's a lot of just
throwing out the line, reeling you back

throwing out the line, reeling you back
in, and just making sure it's not just

in, and just making sure it's not just
this happened, then this happened. Oh,

this happened, then this happened. Oh,
and then we did this, and then this.

and then we did this, and then this.
When you tell a good story, you can

When you tell a good story, you can
really keep them engaged, and you can

really keep them engaged, and you can
say things in the video that sell

say things in the video that sell
somebody on a psychological level. These

somebody on a psychological level. These
are all really, really tiny things.

are all really, really tiny things.
Whether you mention like, "I got this

Whether you mention like, "I got this
product, and I really thought it was

product, and I really thought it was
going to be expensive." And it honestly

going to be expensive." And it honestly
kind of was, but oh my god, it's so

kind of was, but oh my god, it's so
worth it. And it comes off really

worth it. And it comes off really
transparent and honest, like you're just

transparent and honest, like you're just
telling a story or giving them your

telling a story or giving them your
experience with the product and you

experience with the product and you
really like it. And now you haven't even

really like it. And now you haven't even
told them what it is or how much it

told them what it is or how much it
cost. You're just telling them that you

cost. You're just telling them that you
like it so that when you do tell them

like it so that when you do tell them
how much it is or why they should buy it

how much it is or why they should buy it
or how to even buy it in the first

or how to even buy it in the first
place, you've already anchored that you

place, you've already anchored that you
like it and that you are a honest person

like it and that you are a honest person
in the video. So, it's a lot of just

in the video. So, it's a lot of just
kind of psychological selling. And I

kind of psychological selling. And I
have other videos on my page that break

have other videos on my page that break
down this exactly. The main point for

down this exactly. The main point for
this one video that you're watching is

this one video that you're watching is
just to kind of understand the mindset

just to kind of understand the mindset
of a sevenigure affiliate, whether it's

of a sevenigure affiliate, whether it's
myself or anybody I've come across. But

myself or anybody I've come across. But
that is the biggest thing is literally

that is the biggest thing is literally
just understanding how to sell or tell a

just understanding how to sell or tell a
story through your video. Staying

story through your video. Staying
consistent, testing the right products

consistent, testing the right products
and just actually taking action and not

and just actually taking action and not
letting these numbers become a facade

letting these numbers become a facade
and just getting freaked out. Oh, I made

and just getting freaked out. Oh, I made
10 grand. Cool. Next month you make

10 grand. Cool. Next month you make
zero. You start crying and you give up.

zero. You start crying and you give up.
No, you need to make 10 grand and make

No, you need to make 10 grand and make
20 next month and just turn into a

20 next month and just turn into a
robot. Literally just full monk mode and

robot. Literally just full monk mode and
just the numbers are literally numbers

just the numbers are literally numbers
and that's it. It's not even currency.

and that's it. It's not even currency.
Money is not real. I know it sounds

Money is not real. I know it sounds
stupid, but like I'm serious. If you go

stupid, but like I'm serious. If you go
into it with that mindset, you'll make a

into it with that mindset, you'll make a
lot more money. But other than that,

lot more money. But other than that,

I made a few hundred,000 just this year

I made a few hundred,000 just this year
alone posting videos for my iPhone on

alone posting videos for my iPhone on
Tik Tok shops, selling products that I

Tik Tok shops, selling products that I
do not own. But when somebody like you

do not own. But when somebody like you
comes in and watches my video and buys

comes in and watches my video and buys
the product on my video, I get a

the product on my video, I get a
percentage of that sale. Now, the

percentage of that sale. Now, the
biggest thing here is it's mainly

biggest thing here is it's mainly
available in the United States, Canada,

available in the United States, Canada,
and the UK. A lot of people have been

and the UK. A lot of people have been
asking me where to do this. If you're

asking me where to do this. If you're
outside of these countries, there's a

outside of these countries, there's a
few different ways, and it is fully

few different ways, and it is fully
legal, but we are going to have to bend

legal, but we are going to have to bend
the rules just a little bit. So, stick

the rules just a little bit. So, stick
with me here. If you watch this entire

with me here. If you watch this entire
video, you will know how to do exactly

video, you will know how to do exactly
that, and hopefully we'll be able to

that, and hopefully we'll be able to
start doing this by as soon as tomorrow.

start doing this by as soon as tomorrow.
So, I'm going to jump over to my laptop

So, I'm going to jump over to my laptop
and we're going to get straight into

and we're going to get straight into
this. All right, jumping over to my

this. All right, jumping over to my
laptop here. This might seem confusing

laptop here. This might seem confusing
on the surface, but I promise you it's

on the surface, but I promise you it's
actually really simple. I have friends

actually really simple. I have friends
in Canada who are doing this who

in Canada who are doing this who
technically should not be allowed to be

technically should not be allowed to be
posting on Tik Tok shop, but they are.

posting on Tik Tok shop, but they are.
We're going to use a website called

We're going to use a website called
tick.cards. They sell SIM cards that

tick.cards. They sell SIM cards that
plug into your iPhone, and they're

plug into your iPhone, and they're
programs for different countries. So,

programs for different countries. So,
you obviously want to buy one from an

you obviously want to buy one from an
eligible country, which would be the

eligible country, which would be the
United States. It's literally $30. I

United States. It's literally $30. I
think that's like $50 US. Add to your

think that's like $50 US. Add to your
car, buy it. Very simple. This gets

car, buy it. Very simple. This gets
shipped to you. I'd recommend having a

shipped to you. I'd recommend having a
second phone for this just so that you

second phone for this just so that you
don't have two different SIM cards. You

don't have two different SIM cards. You
can get a used iPhone like 8 or 9 or 12

can get a used iPhone like 8 or 9 or 12
for like a couple hundred bucks on eBay.

for like a couple hundred bucks on eBay.
This obviously does cost a little bit of

This obviously does cost a little bit of
money, but it's nothing crazy. So, once

money, but it's nothing crazy. So, once
you have your your US SIM card, you want

you have your your US SIM card, you want
to have a US-based entity. The biggest

to have a US-based entity. The biggest
thing is going to be the location for

thing is going to be the location for
your actual device that's posting these

your actual device that's posting these
videos, which the SIM card is going to

videos, which the SIM card is going to
mask that with the VPN as well as a SIM

mask that with the VPN as well as a SIM
card. And then your your bank account

card. And then your your bank account
for withdrawing your money. Okay? It's

for withdrawing your money. Okay? It's
going to ask you for your bank and your

going to ask you for your bank and your
information. So, you want to start a

information. So, you want to start a
business entity in the United States.

business entity in the United States.

They'll do everything for you and it
costs 250 bucks. Or you can do it for

costs 250 bucks. Or you can do it for
free or not free, but it's a little

free or not free, but it's a little
cheaper if you do it yourself and um go

cheaper if you do it yourself and um go
to like your secretary of state's

to like your secretary of state's
website and create an LLC yourself. It's

website and create an LLC yourself. It's
a little more meticulous though. You

a little more meticulous though. You
have to do it yourself. But if you use

have to do it yourself. But if you use
this website, you pay 250. They create

this website, you pay 250. They create
you an LLC in let's say a state like

you an LLC in let's say a state like
Wyoming, right? Where there's no sales

Wyoming, right? Where there's no sales
tax, but it's in the United States. Now,

There's no customer service, no

Shop. Now, before we get into the video,
the goal here is to explain how to go

the goal here is to explain how to go
from zero to $100,000 on Tik Tok Shop as

from zero to $100,000 on Tik Tok Shop as
a creator as fast as possible. So, I'm

a creator as fast as possible. So, I'm
not going to be covering the basics of

not going to be covering the basics of
like how to find products, how to edit

like how to find products, how to edit
your videos, simple things like that,

your videos, simple things like that,

just that, and you can go watch those on
my channel after this video. All right.

my channel after this video. All right.
Now, given that Tik Tok is literally a

Now, given that Tik Tok is literally a
video platform, we are crafting viral

video platform, we are crafting viral
videos to get attention of consumers and

videos to get attention of consumers and
hopefully sell these products to earn

hopefully sell these products to earn
commission. Now, in the spirit of

commission. Now, in the spirit of
starting from zero, if I was starting

starting from zero, if I was starting
from literally zero to try to make

from literally zero to try to make
$100,000 as fast as possible, I'm going

$100,000 as fast as possible, I'm going
to take a student from my program. His

to take a student from my program. His
name is Christopher. He's a rather new

name is Christopher. He's a rather new
and he was promoting a new product

and he was promoting a new product
called Live Conscious. It's their Beyond

called Live Conscious. It's their Beyond
Brew skew, which is a coffee caffeine

Brew skew, which is a coffee caffeine
alternative. And it had less than 1,000

alternative. And it had less than 1,000
sales. So, we're going to view this as a

sales. So, we're going to view this as a
new product. Now, I'm going to overlay

new product. Now, I'm going to overlay
the video he made on screen directly so

the video he made on screen directly so
that you can watch it, understand what a

that you can watch it, understand what a
viral video looks like, and then we will

viral video looks like, and then we will
break it down. So, my mom just called me

break it down. So, my mom just called me
crying. She's 70 and said that a bunch

crying. She's 70 and said that a bunch
of her old memories had come flooding

of her old memories had come flooding
back. A little backstory here. First, I

back. A little backstory here. First, I
had a bad car accident a while back and

had a bad car accident a while back and
got a severe concussion. For a long

got a severe concussion. For a long
time, I was forgetting simple things I

time, I was forgetting simple things I
had done literally seconds after doing

had done literally seconds after doing
them, like brushing my teeth. And I

them, like brushing my teeth. And I
wouldn't even realize it until I was

wouldn't even realize it until I was
doing it again just moments later. I

doing it again just moments later. I
kept having these heavy brain fog

kept having these heavy brain fog
moments until somewhat recently. All

moments until somewhat recently. All
those videos of doctors and scientists

those videos of doctors and scientists
talking about different types of

talking about different types of
mushrooms and their benefits kept

mushrooms and their benefits kept
popping up on my for you page. And after

popping up on my for you page. And after
2 years of these brain fog incidents, it

2 years of these brain fog incidents, it
only took a month of using a mushroom

only took a month of using a mushroom
supplement and they all stopped. So then

supplement and they all stopped. So then
my mom started supplementing with

my mom started supplementing with
mushrooms too. And her tears were tears

mushrooms too. And her tears were tears
of pure joy when she called. If I had

of pure joy when she called. If I had
known that mushrooms have been used for

known that mushrooms have been used for
centuries because they can preserve

centuries because they can preserve
cognitive function and even expand it, I

cognitive function and even expand it, I
would have already been using mushrooms

would have already been using mushrooms
forever. Not only have some mushrooms

forever. Not only have some mushrooms
been studied and proven to stimulate

been studied and proven to stimulate
nerve growth and brain cells, but there

nerve growth and brain cells, but there
are types of mushrooms that can even aid

are types of mushrooms that can even aid
in digestive health, immune support,

in digestive health, immune support,
ADHD, depression, and anxiety, and

ADHD, depression, and anxiety, and
inflammation. If you're dealing with any

inflammation. If you're dealing with any
of these kind of symptoms, you should

of these kind of symptoms, you should
look for a balanced mushroom blend

look for a balanced mushroom blend
supplement. Live conscious makes the one

supplement. Live conscious makes the one
that I use. Blends six different

that I use. Blends six different
powerful mushrooms to help. It's a

powerful mushrooms to help. It's a
delicious cacao chocolate flavor, and

delicious cacao chocolate flavor, and
all I do is add it to coffee or smoothie

all I do is add it to coffee or smoothie
every day. We've got some other flavors,

every day. We've got some other flavors,
too, and I linked it right here, but

too, and I linked it right here, but
they do sell out fast, so grab yours

they do sell out fast, so grab yours
quick. Now, I wanted to show you that

quick. Now, I wanted to show you that
video on purpose because that only has

video on purpose because that only has
40,000 views. So, by my textbook, that's

40,000 views. So, by my textbook, that's
not exactly viral. But Christopher still

not exactly viral. But Christopher still
made a few thousand dollars on that one

made a few thousand dollars on that one
video alone. So, what made the

video alone. So, what made the
difference? There's really three pillars

difference? There's really three pillars
to a viral video. There is the hook, the

to a viral video. There is the hook, the
body, and the call to action. Now, the

body, and the call to action. Now, the
body is where you want to tell a story.

body is where you want to tell a story.
The hook is where you grab attention.

The hook is where you grab attention.
And the call to action is where you

And the call to action is where you
essentially say, "Hey, go buy this."

essentially say, "Hey, go buy this."
Now, with Christopher's hook, he started

Now, with Christopher's hook, he started
off the video by saying, "So, my mother

off the video by saying, "So, my mother
called me the other day and she was in

called me the other day and she was in
tears." But a quick backstory first. He

tears." But a quick backstory first. He
grabs her attention by saying, "His mom

grabs her attention by saying, "His mom
called you. She's in tears." And then a

called you. She's in tears." And then a
quick backstory first. That's the pivot

quick backstory first. That's the pivot
from the hook to the body. You grab

from the hook to the body. You grab
their attention and then instead of just

their attention and then instead of just
starting to ramble and explain why your

starting to ramble and explain why your
mom called you and all this gibberish,

mom called you and all this gibberish,
he says, "But a quick backstory first to

he says, "But a quick backstory first to
really reel you in and set the tone of

really reel you in and set the tone of
like, hey, let me really explain what's

like, hey, let me really explain what's
going on here." So, he bought your

going on here." So, he bought your
attention and then he has now extended

attention and then he has now extended
it into the rest of the video where he

it into the rest of the video where he
will solely or basically start to go and

will solely or basically start to go and
talk about the product and then insert a

talk about the product and then insert a
call to action. Now, there's some very

call to action. Now, there's some very
key factors here. Obviously, during the

key factors here. Obviously, during the
storytelling, you want to tell a story

storytelling, you want to tell a story
that actually relates to the product. So

that actually relates to the product. So
he brought up his mom crying and a quick

he brought up his mom crying and a quick
backstory first. He explained that she

backstory first. He explained that she
got in a bad car accident. She lost all

got in a bad car accident. She lost all
of her memory and she has literally had

of her memory and she has literally had
no way of getting it back and suddenly

no way of getting it back and suddenly
she tries this product called Beyond

she tries this product called Beyond
Brewage Mushrooms and uh one of the

Brewage Mushrooms and uh one of the
ingredients is actually turkey tail

ingredients is actually turkey tail
which is a really big ingredient in the

which is a really big ingredient in the
like mushroom space that can help with

like mushroom space that can help with
memory loss which is how he's going to

memory loss which is how he's going to
slowly relate the video back to this

slowly relate the video back to this
product. If I was to make a video

product. If I was to make a video
talking about I don't know let's say

talking about I don't know let's say
Coca-Cola Dr. Pepper and I started off

Coca-Cola Dr. Pepper and I started off
by saying my mom c called me crying yada

by saying my mom c called me crying yada
yada yada she got in a car crash. I can

yada yada she got in a car crash. I can
relate that back to Dr. Pepper. But if I

relate that back to Dr. Pepper. But if I
somehow tell the story in a certain way

somehow tell the story in a certain way
where I am able to relate that back to

where I am able to relate that back to
the product like Christopher did, that

the product like Christopher did, that
is how you actually generate these

is how you actually generate these
sales. You can't just make irrelevant

sales. You can't just make irrelevant
content that doesn't relate at all to

content that doesn't relate at all to
the product. Now, when it comes time for

the product. Now, when it comes time for
the call to action where he is

the call to action where he is
essentially saying, "Hey, go buy this."

essentially saying, "Hey, go buy this."
It's very simple. He already bought your

It's very simple. He already bought your
attention. He kept it throughout the

attention. He kept it throughout the
entire video. Now, he says, "Hey, here's

entire video. Now, he says, "Hey, here's
a product. Here's why I like it. The

a product. Here's why I like it. The
only thing I don't really like is they

only thing I don't really like is they
sell out extremely extremely fast. So,

sell out extremely extremely fast. So,
if you want to grab it, there's a few

if you want to grab it, there's a few
different flavors. I linked it right

different flavors. I linked it right
here." And that's literally the entire

here." And that's literally the entire
video. off of just that about 45 second

video. off of just that about 45 second
video. Christopher made a few thousand

video. Christopher made a few thousand
dollars and that was posted over a month

dollars and that was posted over a month
ago. So, he's been making money on a

ago. So, he's been making money on a
consistent basis from a video that he

consistent basis from a video that he
made literally over a month ago. Now

made literally over a month ago. Now
that you understand what a viral video

that you understand what a viral video
concept looks like, I want to touch on

concept looks like, I want to touch on
mindset. I know it sounds corny, but

mindset. I know it sounds corny, but
mindset is the most important thing

mindset is the most important thing
because if you treat TikTok like a
