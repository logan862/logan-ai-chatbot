TikTok. It's only $10. That's the whole

TikTok. It's only $10. That's the whole
video. Okay, so watching this, you

video. Okay, so watching this, you
should now understand like different

should now understand like different
types of video styles. And as I'm

types of video styles. And as I'm
talking, you might say, "Oh, I could do

talking, you might say, "Oh, I could do
skits or oh, I could do this or oh, I

skits or oh, I could do this or oh, I
could do that." And obviously different

could do that." And obviously different
products work better with that. You

products work better with that. You
could not promote, you know, like a a

could not promote, you know, like a a
credit card through a skit. That kind of

credit card through a skit. That kind of
seem or actually you could. But my point

seem or actually you could. But my point
with this is like there's different

with this is like there's different
types of video styles that work better

types of video styles that work better
with other products. Bottom of funnel,

with other products. Bottom of funnel,
you have to do viral products. You could

you have to do viral products. You could
also do a skit or a talking head video

also do a skit or a talking head video
on a brand new product, but you cannot

on a brand new product, but you cannot
do that with bottom of funnel. So, as

do that with bottom of funnel. So, as
you're watching this video, I want you

you're watching this video, I want you
to really break down like, hey, could I

to really break down like, hey, could I
do skits? Could I do bottom funnel? What

do skits? Could I do bottom funnel? What
do I physically see myself like doing

do I physically see myself like doing
well in? Because if you, you know, try

well in? Because if you, you know, try
to force yourself to do skits and you're

to force yourself to do skits and you're
not an outgoing person, you're going to

not an outgoing person, you're going to
make shitty videos respectfully and no

make shitty videos respectfully and no
one's going to watch them. So, that is

one's going to watch them. So, that is
kind of the baseline of like how to make

kind of the baseline of like how to make
viral videos. All right, going in order

viral videos. All right, going in order
here. You should have an account that

here. You should have an account that
you can post on now. You should have an

you can post on now. You should have an
understanding how to find viral products

understanding how to find viral products
and you should have a very good

and you should have a very good
understanding of one what a viral video

understanding of one what a viral video
kind of looks like the structure

kind of looks like the structure
different types of content and overall

different types of content and overall
you should have a conscious idea of like

you should have a conscious idea of like
what you could see yourself doing on Tik

what you could see yourself doing on Tik
Tok shop. Now this is the juiciest part

Tok shop. Now this is the juiciest part
of the video. This all kind of aligns

of the video. This all kind of aligns
with different people's moral compasses

with different people's moral compasses
but you know how to make the videos

but you know how to make the videos
right? You can still leverage that but

right? You can still leverage that but
you also do not need to reinvent the

you also do not need to reinvent the
wheel on Tik Tok shop. Okay, I have my

wheel on Tik Tok shop. Okay, I have my
computer screen pulled up here. And if

computer screen pulled up here. And if
we kind of jump over here, you can

we kind of jump over here, you can
actually go and see other creators that

actually go and see other creators that
are doing insane numbers on Tik Tok shop

are doing insane numbers on Tik Tok shop
and just copy them. Okay, there's still

and just copy them. Okay, there's still
a little bit of skill involved here. You

a little bit of skill involved here. You
still need to understand how to make

still need to understand how to make
these viral concepts cuz you can't just

these viral concepts cuz you can't just
copy a video and do a bad job and it's

copy a video and do a bad job and it's
going to perform the same. That doesn't

going to perform the same. That doesn't
make sense, but you get the point. I'm

make sense, but you get the point. I'm
going to break down some pages here.

going to break down some pages here.
Now, I'm inside of the Tik Tok shop

Now, I'm inside of the Tik Tok shop

access to this because I run an agency
that is a verified Tik Tok shop partner

that is a verified Tik Tok shop partner
and everyone that's in my mentorship

and everyone that's in my mentorship
program gets access to this. So again,

program gets access to this. So again,
there is a application down in the

this information, too, but I'm just

this information, too, but I'm just
showing you guys this way because it's

showing you guys this way because it's
easy for me to display this. But let's

easy for me to display this. But let's
take this girl for example, right? In

take this girl for example, right? In
the past 30 days, she has done almost

the past 30 days, she has done almost
$400,000 in gross merchandise volume.

$400,000 in gross merchandise volume.
Now, if we look at her page, if it wants

to load here, um 99.97%

to load here, um 99.97%
of her $400,000 in sales is through

of her $400,000 in sales is through
videos. She's literally just making

videos. She's literally just making
videos. Now, her average commission rate

videos. Now, her average commission rate
is 15%. So, she's making what is 15% of

is 15%. So, she's making what is 15% of
400,000. She's making like around 50k

400,000. She's making like around 50k
60k a month in profit, which is absurd.

60k a month in profit, which is absurd.
Now, if we go look at her page, hey,

Now, if we go look at her page, hey,
this girl is doing very, very well. So,

this girl is doing very, very well. So,
do we need to, you know, like reinvent

do we need to, you know, like reinvent
the wheel? No. Look at this. She has
