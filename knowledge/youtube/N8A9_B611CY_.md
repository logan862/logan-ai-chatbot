the goal here is to explain how to go

the goal here is to explain how to go
from zero to $100,000 on Tik Tok Shop as

from zero to $100,000 on Tik Tok Shop as
a creator as fast as possible. So, I'm

a creator as fast as possible. So, I'm
not going to be covering the basics of

not going to be covering the basics of
like how to find products, how to edit

like how to find products, how to edit
your videos, simple things like that,

your videos, simple things like that,
because I already have videos explaining

because I already have videos explaining
just that, and you can go watch those on

just that, and you can go watch those on
my channel after this video. All right.

my channel after this video. All right.
Now, given that Tik Tok is literally a

Now, given that Tik Tok is literally a
video platform, we are crafting viral

video platform, we are crafting viral
videos to get attention of consumers and

videos to get attention of consumers and
hopefully sell these products to earn

hopefully sell these products to earn
commission. Now, in the spirit of

commission. Now, in the spirit of
starting from zero, if I was starting

starting from zero, if I was starting
from literally zero to try to make

from literally zero to try to make
$100,000 as fast as possible, I'm going

$100,000 as fast as possible, I'm going
to take a student from my program. His

to take a student from my program. His
name is Christopher. He's a rather new

name is Christopher. He's a rather new
and he was promoting a new product

and he was promoting a new product
called Live Conscious. It's their Beyond

called Live Conscious. It's their Beyond
Brew skew, which is a coffee caffeine

Brew skew, which is a coffee caffeine
alternative. And it had less than 1,000

alternative. And it had less than 1,000
sales. So, we're going to view this as a

sales. So, we're going to view this as a
new product. Now, I'm going to overlay

new product. Now, I'm going to overlay
the video he made on screen directly so

the video he made on screen directly so
that you can watch it, understand what a

that you can watch it, understand what a
viral video looks like, and then we will

viral video looks like, and then we will
break it down. So, my mom just called me

break it down. So, my mom just called me
crying. She's 70 and said that a bunch

crying. She's 70 and said that a bunch
of her old memories had come flooding

of her old memories had come flooding
back. A little backstory here. First, I

back. A little backstory here. First, I
had a bad car accident a while back and

had a bad car accident a while back and
got a severe concussion. For a long

got a severe concussion. For a long
time, I was forgetting simple things I

time, I was forgetting simple things I
had done literally seconds after doing

had done literally seconds after doing
them, like brushing my teeth. And I

them, like brushing my teeth. And I
wouldn't even realize it until I was

wouldn't even realize it until I was
doing it again just moments later. I

doing it again just moments later. I
kept having these heavy brain fog

kept having these heavy brain fog
moments until somewhat recently. All

moments until somewhat recently. All
those videos of doctors and scientists

those videos of doctors and scientists
talking about different types of

talking about different types of
mushrooms and their benefits kept

mushrooms and their benefits kept
popping up on my for you page. And after

popping up on my for you page. And after
2 years of these brain fog incidents, it

2 years of these brain fog incidents, it
only took a month of using a mushroom

only took a month of using a mushroom
supplement and they all stopped. So then

supplement and they all stopped. So then
my mom started supplementing with

my mom started supplementing with
mushrooms too. And her tears were tears

mushrooms too. And her tears were tears
of pure joy when she called. If I had

of pure joy when she called. If I had
known that mushrooms have been used for

known that mushrooms have been used for
centuries because they can preserve

centuries because they can preserve
cognitive function and even expand it, I

cognitive function and even expand it, I
would have already been using mushrooms

would have already been using mushrooms
forever. Not only have some mushrooms

forever. Not only have some mushrooms
been studied and proven to stimulate

been studied and proven to stimulate
nerve growth and brain cells, but there

nerve growth and brain cells, but there
are types of mushrooms that can even aid

are types of mushrooms that can even aid
in digestive health, immune support,

in digestive health, immune support,
ADHD, depression, and anxiety, and

ADHD, depression, and anxiety, and
inflammation. If you're dealing with any

inflammation. If you're dealing with any
of these kind of symptoms, you should

of these kind of symptoms, you should
look for a balanced mushroom blend

look for a balanced mushroom blend
supplement. Live conscious makes the one

supplement. Live conscious makes the one
that I use. Blends six different

that I use. Blends six different
powerful mushrooms to help. It's a

powerful mushrooms to help. It's a
delicious cacao chocolate flavor, and

delicious cacao chocolate flavor, and
all I do is add it to coffee or smoothie

all I do is add it to coffee or smoothie
every day. We've got some other flavors,

every day. We've got some other flavors,
too, and I linked it right here, but

too, and I linked it right here, but
they do sell out fast, so grab yours

they do sell out fast, so grab yours
quick. Now, I wanted to show you that

quick. Now, I wanted to show you that
video on purpose because that only has

video on purpose because that only has
40,000 views. So, by my textbook, that's

40,000 views. So, by my textbook, that's
not exactly viral. But Christopher still

not exactly viral. But Christopher still
made a few thousand dollars on that one

made a few thousand dollars on that one
video alone. So, what made the

video alone. So, what made the
difference? There's really three pillars

difference? There's really three pillars
to a viral video. There is the hook, the

to a viral video. There is the hook, the
body, and the call to action. Now, the

body, and the call to action. Now, the
body is where you want to tell a story.

body is where you want to tell a story.
The hook is where you grab attention.

The hook is where you grab attention.
And the call to action is where you

And the call to action is where you
essentially say, "Hey, go buy this."

essentially say, "Hey, go buy this."
Now, with Christopher's hook, he started

Now, with Christopher's hook, he started
off the video by saying, "So, my mother

off the video by saying, "So, my mother
called me the other day and she was in

called me the other day and she was in
tears." But a quick backstory first. He

tears." But a quick backstory first. He
grabs her attention by saying, "His mom

grabs her attention by saying, "His mom
called you. She's in tears." And then a

called you. She's in tears." And then a
quick backstory first. That's the pivot

quick backstory first. That's the pivot
from the hook to the body. You grab

from the hook to the body. You grab
their attention and then instead of just

their attention and then instead of just
starting to ramble and explain why your

starting to ramble and explain why your
mom called you and all this gibberish,

mom called you and all this gibberish,
he says, "But a quick backstory first to

he says, "But a quick backstory first to
really reel you in and set the tone of

really reel you in and set the tone of
like, hey, let me really explain what's

like, hey, let me really explain what's
going on here." So, he bought your

going on here." So, he bought your
attention and then he has now extended

attention and then he has now extended
it into the rest of the video where he

it into the rest of the video where he
will solely or basically start to go and

will solely or basically start to go and
talk about the product and then insert a

talk about the product and then insert a
call to action. Now, there's some very

call to action. Now, there's some very
key factors here. Obviously, during the

key factors here. Obviously, during the
storytelling, you want to tell a story

storytelling, you want to tell a story
that actually relates to the product. So

that actually relates to the product. So
he brought up his mom crying and a quick

he brought up his mom crying and a quick
backstory first. He explained that she

backstory first. He explained that she
got in a bad car accident. She lost all

got in a bad car accident. She lost all
of her memory and she has literally had

of her memory and she has literally had
no way of getting it back and suddenly

no way of getting it back and suddenly
she tries this product called Beyond

she tries this product called Beyond
Brewage Mushrooms and uh one of the

Brewage Mushrooms and uh one of the
ingredients is actually turkey tail

ingredients is actually turkey tail
which is a really big ingredient in the

which is a really big ingredient in the
like mushroom space that can help with

like mushroom space that can help with
memory loss which is how he's going to

memory loss which is how he's going to
slowly relate the video back to this

slowly relate the video back to this
product. If I was to make a video

product. If I was to make a video
talking about I don't know let's say

talking about I don't know let's say
Coca-Cola Dr. Pepper and I started off

Coca-Cola Dr. Pepper and I started off
by saying my mom c called me crying yada

by saying my mom c called me crying yada
yada yada she got in a car crash. I can

yada yada she got in a car crash. I can
relate that back to Dr. Pepper. But if I

relate that back to Dr. Pepper. But if I
somehow tell the story in a certain way

somehow tell the story in a certain way
where I am able to relate that back to

where I am able to relate that back to
the product like Christopher did, that

the product like Christopher did, that
is how you actually generate these

is how you actually generate these
sales. You can't just make irrelevant

sales. You can't just make irrelevant
content that doesn't relate at all to

content that doesn't relate at all to
the product. Now, when it comes time for

the product. Now, when it comes time for
the call to action where he is

the call to action where he is
essentially saying, "Hey, go buy this."

essentially saying, "Hey, go buy this."
It's very simple. He already bought your

It's very simple. He already bought your
attention. He kept it throughout the

attention. He kept it throughout the
entire video. Now, he says, "Hey, here's

entire video. Now, he says, "Hey, here's
a product. Here's why I like it. The

a product. Here's why I like it. The
only thing I don't really like is they

only thing I don't really like is they
sell out extremely extremely fast. So,

sell out extremely extremely fast. So,
if you want to grab it, there's a few

if you want to grab it, there's a few
different flavors. I linked it right

different flavors. I linked it right
here." And that's literally the entire

here." And that's literally the entire
video. off of just that about 45 second

video. off of just that about 45 second
video. Christopher made a few thousand

video. Christopher made a few thousand
dollars and that was posted over a month

dollars and that was posted over a month
ago. So, he's been making money on a

ago. So, he's been making money on a
consistent basis from a video that he

consistent basis from a video that he
made literally over a month ago. Now

made literally over a month ago. Now
that you understand what a viral video

that you understand what a viral video
concept looks like, I want to touch on

mindset is the most important thing
