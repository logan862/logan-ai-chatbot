And across these couple years, I've

And across these couple years, I've
actually coached or at the bare minimum

come in contact and had a conversation

come in contact and had a conversation
with every single top affiliate that is

with every single top affiliate that is
on the platform making the most money.

on the platform making the most money.
And I've actually noticed pretty much

And I've actually noticed pretty much
all of them have at least one similarity

all of them have at least one similarity
in common. So, in this video, I'm going

in common. So, in this video, I'm going
to be breaking down every single thing

to be breaking down every single thing
that I use and that I've noticed between

that I use and that I've noticed between
all these top affiliates who are making

all these top affiliates who are making
10, 20, 50, even $100,000 in a single

10, 20, 50, even $100,000 in a single
month so that you can copy it by the end

month so that you can copy it by the end
of this video. First things first, if

Tok Shop as a platform came out

Tok Shop as a platform came out
literally about 2 years ago. It's still

literally about 2 years ago. It's still
so new and we are all still so early to

so new and we are all still so early to
this, but I started pretty much on day

this, but I started pretty much on day
one when Tik Tok Shop came out when

one when Tik Tok Shop came out when
pretty much nobody was doing it. And so

pretty much nobody was doing it. And so
I did see success very early on because

I did see success very early on because
there was low competition. And I wish I

there was low competition. And I wish I
could go back to those days. But on my

could go back to those days. But on my
fourth ever video that I posted, I

fourth ever video that I posted, I
pulled in about $10,000 in profit

pulled in about $10,000 in profit
literally on a random carport scanner

literally on a random carport scanner
that tells you what's wrong with your

that tells you what's wrong with your
car. And I made $10,000 on one video.

car. And I made $10,000 on one video.
Ever since then, I have not looked back.

Ever since then, I have not looked back.
I've doubled, tripled, quadrupled down

I've doubled, tripled, quadrupled down
on my Tik Tok shop journey. I've also

on my Tik Tok shop journey. I've also
been documenting my journey for the past

been documenting my journey for the past
two years on social media. So I've also

two years on social media. So I've also
picked up a lot of students and coached

picked up a lot of students and coached
a lot of people. And again, that's why

a lot of people. And again, that's why
I'm making this video because I don't

I'm making this video because I don't
want to sound like a douchebag, but I've

want to sound like a douchebag, but I've
either coached your favorite top

either coached your favorite top
affiliates who you've probably seen who

affiliates who you've probably seen who
now sell courses across the same method

now sell courses across the same method
that I've taught them or they are just a

that I've taught them or they are just a
very good affiliate and I've had the

very good affiliate and I've had the
chance to speak with them and interview

chance to speak with them and interview
them or talk with them. And every single

them or talk with them. And every single
one of these people has very similar

one of these people has very similar
traits to where I want to break that

traits to where I want to break that
down in this video so that you at the

down in this video so that you at the
end of this video could watch that and

end of this video could watch that and
duplicate all of our success combined

duplicate all of our success combined
and basically start today with what I

and basically start today with what I
had or what I wish I had, you know, 3

had or what I wish I had, you know, 3
years ago and see success way faster.

years ago and see success way faster.
So, just diving straight into it. When

So, just diving straight into it. When
I've had conversations with these

I've had conversations with these
affiliates or even myself, one thing

affiliates or even myself, one thing
that I've noticed with every single one

that I've noticed with every single one
of them is they all have something

of them is they all have something
unique about them. This is a common

unique about them. This is a common
overlooked tactic. Now, I will give you

overlooked tactic. Now, I will give you
an example for me. I went to Costa Rica.

an example for me. I went to Costa Rica.
I got super tan. So, I started selling

I got super tan. So, I started selling
tanning products because, again, I'm

tanning products because, again, I'm
tan. The average person maybe isn't tan,

tan. The average person maybe isn't tan,
so that's my leverage. Uh, one of my

so that's my leverage. Uh, one of my
friends, he is extremely muscular. He's

friends, he is extremely muscular. He's
an ex-marine. He makes about 40 grand a

an ex-marine. He makes about 40 grand a

helping young men who might be insecure
get jacked, put on muscle, get

get jacked, put on muscle, get
healthier, whatever, because he is the

healthier, whatever, because he is the
poster child of the freaking US Marines.

poster child of the freaking US Marines.
The guy's jacked, so he is a really good

The guy's jacked, so he is a really good
fit for that type of content. There was

fit for that type of content. There was
this girl I know, she used to be a

this girl I know, she used to be a
registered nurse. She has scrubs, she

registered nurse. She has scrubs, she
looks like a nurse, she acts like a

looks like a nurse, she acts like a
nurse, she has the terminology and

nurse, she has the terminology and
everything in her vocabulary that is

everything in her vocabulary that is
literally a nurse. So, she was selling

literally a nurse. So, she was selling
supplements for weight loss, for health,

supplements for weight loss, for health,
for vitamins, literally anything. But

for vitamins, literally anything. But
that is her kind of niche and what she

that is her kind of niche and what she
does. Well, moral of the story, every

does. Well, moral of the story, every
single person has something unique about

single person has something unique about
them. If you're fat, whether you want to

them. If you're fat, whether you want to
admit it or not, you can sell weight

admit it or not, you can sell weight

trinkets, toys, like literally anything.

trinkets, toys, like literally anything.
Every single person watching this video

Every single person watching this video
has something unique about them. Maybe

has something unique about them. Maybe
it's your car, you have a fast car, make

it's your car, you have a fast car, make
car videos. It does not matter.

car videos. It does not matter.
Something is unique about you and that's

Something is unique about you and that's
why you're trying to do this and make

why you're trying to do this and make
this work. So, leverage that and use it.

this work. So, leverage that and use it.
Now, another common trait that I found

Now, another common trait that I found
with every single one of these Tik Tok

with every single one of these Tik Tok
shop affiliates that I spoke with, this

shop affiliates that I spoke with, this
was none of their first business models.

was none of their first business models.
Like, none of them had started Tik Tok

Like, none of them had started Tik Tok
as their very first one. They were

as their very first one. They were
coming from drop shipping, Amazon, ecom,

coming from drop shipping, Amazon, ecom,
wholesaling, real estate, like literally

wholesaling, real estate, like literally
anything. They all came from something,

anything. They all came from something,
which I thought was very unique. And

which I thought was very unique. And
what I got from that is basically most

what I got from that is basically most
people when they make their first

people when they make their first
$10,000 in a month, they think they're

$10,000 in a month, they think they're
the Excuse my French, but they

the Excuse my French, but they
think they're the They're on top

think they're the They're on top
of the world. They are bulletproof,

of the world. They are bulletproof,
right? And that can get very jaded very

right? And that can get very jaded very
fast. Now, the reason I bring this up is

fast. Now, the reason I bring this up is
because Tik Tok shop is very volatile.

because Tik Tok shop is very volatile.
If you make 10 grand in a month, I had

If you make 10 grand in a month, I had
one of my students do this last week.

one of my students do this last week.
They made 10 grand in a month for the

They made 10 grand in a month for the
first time. They were on top of the

first time. They were on top of the
world and then their sales plummeted a

world and then their sales plummeted a
week later because that one viral video

week later because that one viral video
that was going to change their life fell

that was going to change their life fell
off and now they think they're broke.

off and now they think they're broke.
They're all materialistic. They're just

They're all materialistic. They're just
like honed down on just the numbers. And

like honed down on just the numbers. And
that's the biggest thing is when you

that's the biggest thing is when you
start making money, you need to

start making money, you need to
literally be emotionless. Shut off your

literally be emotionless. Shut off your
brain. No emotions, nothing. If you make

brain. No emotions, nothing. If you make
10 grand, great. put it to the side,

10 grand, great. put it to the side,
invest it, whatever. But something has

invest it, whatever. But something has
to change where the numbers are

to change where the numbers are
literally just numbers on screen,

literally just numbers on screen,
nothing more and nothing less. If you

nothing more and nothing less. If you
get tied to 10 grand a month and a

get tied to 10 grand a month and a
million views, if your videos aren't

million views, if your videos aren't
getting a million views each time, which

getting a million views each time, which
is literally impossible to get a million

is literally impossible to get a million
views on every single video, that's just

views on every single video, that's just
not going to happen. You will get tied

not going to happen. You will get tied
into this limiting mindset and you will

into this limiting mindset and you will
eventually get burnt out. You'll have

eventually get burnt out. You'll have
three videos that pop off and then your

three videos that pop off and then your
next 30 videos that you post will get a

next 30 videos that you post will get a
couple thousand views, which is normal.

couple thousand views, which is normal.
people go through waves and you're going

people go through waves and you're going
to think it's dead or it's saturated or

to think it's dead or it's saturated or
you're burnt or it's not going to work

you're burnt or it's not going to work
and then you fall off and that is how

and then you fall off and that is how
pretty much every single person I've

pretty much every single person I've
talked to had made money and then fell

talked to had made money and then fell
off. They all fall into this trap. So,

off. They all fall into this trap. So,
uh just you literally have to be so

uh just you literally have to be so
emotionless. Another thing I noticed is

emotionless. Another thing I noticed is
they all utilize what I kind of call the

they all utilize what I kind of call the
10day method. Now, this is where you're

10day method. Now, this is where you're
basically testing for products and

basically testing for products and
seeing if this is even kind of worth

seeing if this is even kind of worth
your time to promote. So, they don't

your time to promote. So, they don't
just jump ship from product 1 2 3 4 20.

just jump ship from product 1 2 3 4 20.
They pick one or two products, even

They pick one or two products, even
three sometimes, and they hone down on

three sometimes, and they hone down on
those for a good one, two weeks and see

those for a good one, two weeks and see
what happens. Now, we've kind of tweaked

what happens. Now, we've kind of tweaked
this a bit inside of my program. We call

this a bit inside of my program. We call
the 10day method where you take three

the 10day method where you take three
products and you post one video on each

products and you post one video on each
product. So, one video on product A, one

product. So, one video on product A, one
video on product B, one video on product

video on product B, one video on product
C, and that is day one. You do the same

C, and that is day one. You do the same
thing for day 2, three, four, five,

thing for day 2, three, four, five,
etc., and you look at the similar

etc., and you look at the similar
traits. Now, by day four, if product A

traits. Now, by day four, if product A
is the one that's historically getting

is the one that's historically getting
the more views in product B and C on

the more views in product B and C on
your videos, maybe on day five or six,

your videos, maybe on day five or six,
you post three videos on just product A,

you post three videos on just product A,
or vice versa with B or C. It does not

or vice versa with B or C. It does not
matter. We're basically just picking

matter. We're basically just picking
three products that fit us. So, let's

three products that fit us. So, let's
say a tanning gel cuz I'm tan, maybe a

say a tanning gel cuz I'm tan, maybe a
hair cream because I have curly hair,

hair cream because I have curly hair,
and maybe something for my watch cuz I

and maybe something for my watch cuz I
like watches, whatever. We pick three

like watches, whatever. We pick three
products that we think fit us, they have

products that we think fit us, they have
good sales volume, whatever. Right now,

good sales volume, whatever. Right now,
we post uh three videos a day on each of

we post uh three videos a day on each of
those individual products. See what

those individual products. See what
trends we're noticing, whether it's

trends we're noticing, whether it's
retention rate, view count, likes,

retention rate, view count, likes,
comments, anything. Or even sales. Sales

comments, anything. Or even sales. Sales
would be the biggest one. What is

would be the biggest one. What is
working on our page and then honing down

working on our page and then honing down
on that? You do that for about 10 days.

on that? You do that for about 10 days.
And if you're not getting literally any

And if you're not getting literally any
conversions, if it's just dry across the

conversions, if it's just dry across the
board, find new products or change your

board, find new products or change your
content style. Um, that's another thing,

content style. Um, that's another thing,
too. If you have really low views, it's

too. If you have really low views, it's
probably your content, not the product.

probably your content, not the product.
If you have high views, no sales, it's

If you have high views, no sales, it's
the product. Okay? But moral of the

the product. Okay? But moral of the
story, all these affiliates that I've

story, all these affiliates that I've
talked to, they all understand how to

talked to, they all understand how to
test products and like actually commit

test products and like actually commit
to it and not just, you know, make

to it and not just, you know, make
literally one video on this tanning gel

literally one video on this tanning gel
and then die. Okay, prime example. I

and then die. Okay, prime example. I
literally made five videos on this. My

literally made five videos on this. My
fifth one blew up. One through four did

fifth one blew up. One through four did
not blow up, but the fifth video blew up

not blow up, but the fifth video blew up
because I looked at what happened on

because I looked at what happened on
video one, two, three, and four. And

video one, two, three, and four. And
then my fifth one got a quarter million

then my fifth one got a quarter million
views and I made some money on it. And

views and I made some money on it. And
that's all you have to do. Now, the last

that's all you have to do. Now, the last
and final thing that I've noticed is

and final thing that I've noticed is
they're all very good at either telling

they're all very good at either telling
a story or just selling. Now, this might

a story or just selling. Now, this might
have been from past experience or

have been from past experience or
whatever it may be from, but all of them

whatever it may be from, but all of them
really understand how to tell a good

really understand how to tell a good
story and how to actually sell on a

story and how to actually sell on a
psychological level. And I will break

psychological level. And I will break
that down. So, basically, when you're

that down. So, basically, when you're
telling a story, it doesn't want to just

telling a story, it doesn't want to just
be so this happened and then this

be so this happened and then this
happened and then I went to here and

happened and then I went to here and
then we did this. It's a lot of and and

then we did this. It's a lot of and and
and people don't care because it's the

and people don't care because it's the
same outcome every time compared to if

same outcome every time compared to if
you said um hey, so we did uh we went to

you said um hey, so we did uh we went to
XYZ and you wouldn't believe what

XYZ and you wouldn't believe what
happened when we were there basically.

happened when we were there basically.
So, just that one switch, you wouldn't

So, just that one switch, you wouldn't
believe what happened when we were

believe what happened when we were
there. You're basically forecasting the

there. You're basically forecasting the
next chunk of your story before even

next chunk of your story before even
telling it. I actually had one of my

telling it. I actually had one of my
creators do this. His hook, he said, um,

creators do this. His hook, he said, um,
so my mom called me the other day in

so my mom called me the other day in
tears and she was crying because all of

tears and she was crying because all of
her memories came flooding back at the

her memories came flooding back at the
ripe age of 40. That's the hook. And

ripe age of 40. That's the hook. And
then right after that, he said, "But a

then right after that, he said, "But a
little bit of backstory first." So my

little bit of backstory first." So my
mom got into a really bad car crash. And

mom got into a really bad car crash. And
just those four, like four or five

just those four, like four or five
words, but a little bit of backstory

words, but a little bit of backstory
first. Now he kind of reeled you in. He

first. Now he kind of reeled you in. He
gets to explain a good chunk of the

gets to explain a good chunk of the
story before he loses you again. And

story before he loses you again. And
then in the middle of that, he'll kind

then in the middle of that, he'll kind
of reel you back in. It's a lot of just

of reel you back in. It's a lot of just
throwing out the line, reeling you back

throwing out the line, reeling you back
in, and just making sure it's not just

in, and just making sure it's not just
this happened, then this happened. Oh,

this happened, then this happened. Oh,
and then we did this, and then this.

and then we did this, and then this.
When you tell a good story, you can

When you tell a good story, you can
really keep them engaged, and you can

really keep them engaged, and you can
say things in the video that sell

say things in the video that sell
somebody on a psychological level. These

somebody on a psychological level. These
are all really, really tiny things.

are all really, really tiny things.
Whether you mention like, "I got this

Whether you mention like, "I got this
product, and I really thought it was

product, and I really thought it was
going to be expensive." And it honestly

going to be expensive." And it honestly
kind of was, but oh my god, it's so

kind of was, but oh my god, it's so
worth it. And it comes off really

worth it. And it comes off really
transparent and honest, like you're just

transparent and honest, like you're just
telling a story or giving them your

telling a story or giving them your
experience with the product and you

experience with the product and you
really like it. And now you haven't even

really like it. And now you haven't even
told them what it is or how much it

told them what it is or how much it
cost. You're just telling them that you

cost. You're just telling them that you
like it so that when you do tell them

like it so that when you do tell them
how much it is or why they should buy it

how much it is or why they should buy it
or how to even buy it in the first

or how to even buy it in the first
place, you've already anchored that you

place, you've already anchored that you
like it and that you are a honest person

like it and that you are a honest person
in the video. So, it's a lot of just

in the video. So, it's a lot of just
kind of psychological selling. And I

kind of psychological selling. And I
have other videos on my page that break

have other videos on my page that break
down this exactly. The main point for

down this exactly. The main point for
this one video that you're watching is

this one video that you're watching is
just to kind of understand the mindset

just to kind of understand the mindset
of a sevenigure affiliate, whether it's

of a sevenigure affiliate, whether it's
myself or anybody I've come across. But

myself or anybody I've come across. But
that is the biggest thing is literally

that is the biggest thing is literally
just understanding how to sell or tell a

just understanding how to sell or tell a
story through your video. Staying

story through your video. Staying
consistent, testing the right products

consistent, testing the right products
and just actually taking action and not

and just actually taking action and not
letting these numbers become a facade

letting these numbers become a facade
and just getting freaked out. Oh, I made

and just getting freaked out. Oh, I made
10 grand. Cool. Next month you make

10 grand. Cool. Next month you make
zero. You start crying and you give up.

zero. You start crying and you give up.
No, you need to make 10 grand and make

No, you need to make 10 grand and make
20 next month and just turn into a

20 next month and just turn into a
robot. Literally just full monk mode and

robot. Literally just full monk mode and
just the numbers are literally numbers

just the numbers are literally numbers
and that's it. It's not even currency.

and that's it. It's not even currency.
Money is not real. I know it sounds

Money is not real. I know it sounds
stupid, but like I'm serious. If you go

stupid, but like I'm serious. If you go
into it with that mindset, you'll make a

into it with that mindset, you'll make a
lot more money. But other than that,

lot more money. But other than that,
