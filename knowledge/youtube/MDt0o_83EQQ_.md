if I told you that 99% of those people

if I told you that 99% of those people
are missing a way bigger opportunity?

are missing a way bigger opportunity?
I've seen a bunch of news flying around

I've seen a bunch of news flying around
about clipping where you basically

about clipping where you basically
make short form content on highv value

make short form content on highv value
creators. When you generate them views,

creators. When you generate them views,
you get paid out an RPM, which is a

you get paid out an RPM, which is a
payment for every thousand views that

payment for every thousand views that
you generate. And don't get me wrong,

you generate. And don't get me wrong,
this business model works, but there is

this business model works, but there is
something so much better where you're

something so much better where you're
utilizing the exact same skills except

utilizing the exact same skills except
you're just getting paid five, sometimes

you're just getting paid five, sometimes
even 10 times more. So why would you not

even 10 times more. So why would you not
want to do that over w clipping? Now,

want to do that over w clipping? Now,
what I'm talking about is Tik Tok Shop

what I'm talking about is Tik Tok Shop
affiliate where you take products like

affiliate where you take products like
this one where you don't own it. There's

this one where you don't own it. There's
no inventory. There's no customer

no inventory. There's no customer
support. There's no business admin work.

support. There's no business admin work.
There's literally nothing. You're just

There's literally nothing. You're just
making short form content promoting that

making short form content promoting that
product and you get a percentage of the

product and you get a percentage of the
sale price which can be anywhere from 5

sale price which can be anywhere from 5
to 10% all the way up to 70%. So, it

to 10% all the way up to 70%. So, it
pays a lot more than WAP clipping. But,

pays a lot more than WAP clipping. But,
let's break down the pros and cons of

let's break down the pros and cons of
both and which one that I would prefer.

both and which one that I would prefer.
First things first, let's look at

First things first, let's look at
In my opinion, it is a lot more

In my opinion, it is a lot more
technical. Basically, what you're doing

technical. Basically, what you're doing
is taking a highvalue creator. Let's say

is taking a highvalue creator. Let's say
TJR Trades for example. You have to go

TJR Trades for example. You have to go
to his YouTube, his Twitch, his

to his YouTube, his Twitch, his
Instagram, his Tik Tok, all these social

Instagram, his Tik Tok, all these social
media platforms. Sort through hours of

media platforms. Sort through hours of
content to find out what you actually

content to find out what you actually
want to clip. And then once you find

want to clip. And then once you find
that, you have to put that into editing

that, you have to put that into editing
software, actually clip it, make it very

software, actually clip it, make it very
entertaining, add edits. It's very

entertaining, add edits. It's very
meticulous and you need to know how to

meticulous and you need to know how to
edit to an extent. And then when you

edit to an extent. And then when you
post it, you either get paid about a

post it, you either get paid about a
dollar per every thousand views or you

dollar per every thousand views or you
don't get paid at all depending on if

don't get paid at all depending on if
the video performs and you're competing

the video performs and you're competing
with thousands of other creators doing

with thousands of other creators doing
the exact same thing on the exact same

the exact same thing on the exact same
creator. Now, let's look at Tik Tok

creator. Now, let's look at Tik Tok
shop. Obviously, it is a similar concept

shop. Obviously, it is a similar concept
where you're making short form content

where you're making short form content
to promote products you don't own. Kind

to promote products you don't own. Kind
of like you're promoting a creator that

of like you're promoting a creator that
you're not associated with and you get

you're not associated with and you get
paid based off the sales that you

paid based off the sales that you
generate. But the difference here is

generate. But the difference here is
there are millions of different types of

there are millions of different types of
products on Tik Tok shop. Whereas, if I

products on Tik Tok shop. Whereas, if I
was clipping TGR or a different creator,

was clipping TGR or a different creator,
I'm competing with thousands of clippers

I'm competing with thousands of clippers
on just TJR. Whereas with Tik Tok shop,

on just TJR. Whereas with Tik Tok shop,
there are millions of products to where

there are millions of products to where
I can take a million different products,

I can take a million different products,
a million different selling angles, a

a million different selling angles, a
million different video types, and use

million different video types, and use
my creative freedom to make these short

my creative freedom to make these short
form content, which clearly I and you

form content, which clearly I and you
are good at, and promote that product to

are good at, and promote that product to
hopefully generate a sale. And with

hopefully generate a sale. And with
these products, there are some that are

these products, there are some that are
at zero or less than a thousand sales

at zero or less than a thousand sales
where there's not much competition

where there's not much competition
because the product is not viral yet.

because the product is not viral yet.
So, you can focus on those, but they're

So, you can focus on those, but they're
harder to promote. Or you can take the

harder to promote. Or you can take the
products that are already super viral

products that are already super viral
and just copy viral concepts and put

and just copy viral concepts and put
your own spin on it, which is very low

your own spin on it, which is very low
effort. There's even software tools, one

effort. There's even software tools, one
that I'm creating, where you can find

that I'm creating, where you can find
these viral videos and literally just

these viral videos and literally just
copy them. Now, let's talk about how

copy them. Now, let's talk about how
scalable this really is. If you clicked

scalable this really is. If you clicked
on this video, given the title of me

on this video, given the title of me
talking about not doing clipping,

talking about not doing clipping,
you're probably either clipping on

you're probably either clipping on
or you considering to clip on And

or you considering to clip on And
now that I presented an alternative,

now that I presented an alternative,
let's break down how scalable this

let's break down how scalable this
really is. With clipping, you're

really is. With clipping, you're
clipping a creator. So, you either have

clipping a creator. So, you either have
to do it yourself or hire a team of

to do it yourself or hire a team of
editors to do it for you. So, yes, it's

editors to do it for you. So, yes, it's
scalable, but there's a lot of software

scalable, but there's a lot of software
costs and employee costs as you scale.

costs and employee costs as you scale.
